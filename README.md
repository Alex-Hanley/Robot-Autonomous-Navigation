# Robot-Autonomous-Navigation

In this lab, our focus was on understanding and implementing software that enables intelligent autonomous
navigation using the iRobot® Create® 3 Roomba Robot. Our goala were to do the following:

- Acquire the skills to program a robot for autonomous navigation to a destination, including
understanding and applying sensor data for real-time navigation decisions.
-Developing algorithms for a robot to detect obstacles and navigate around them effectively.
- Crafting algorithms that enable a robot to dynamically alter its path based on environmental feedback,
simulating real-world navigation scenarios.
- Sharpening the ability to identify and solve programming and operational issues in autonomous systems.


# AutonomousDelivery

The autonomous delivery market is on the rise as e-commerce continues to grow. Companies increasingly
employ robots to deliver a wide range of items, including groceries, pharmaceuticals, and critical medical
supplies, particularly to the elderly and in remote locations. These robots are programmed with a set destination
and rely on autonomous navigation systems to avoid obstacles and adapt to varied conditions during transit. In
this portion, we designed and implemented a simulation of this technology within the confines of a single room. Our
system enables a robot to move toward a specified goal while intelligently avoiding collisions with various
obstacles.


# Maze-Solver

Cities consist of intricate networks of streets, featuring complex intersections, dead-ends, and occasional
blockages. These challenges necessitate dynamic path planning. Consequently, mazes provide an excellent
analog for simulating navigation in such complex urban layouts. Maze solving is a classic challenge in both
mathematics and computer science, often used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of various path
planning strategies. Specifically, it tests their ability to find the most efficient, shortest paths through these
labyrinthine environments. In this portion, our system enables a robot to move towards a target destination in a maze,
naviagting around various obsticles and learning from its environment. 


# Conclusion

In this lab, our robot  demonstrated proficient autonomous navigation through
a maze, effectively reaching its designated destination. Key accomplishments include:

- Accurate navigation: The robot was able to interpret its environment using IR sensors and
accurately determine its position and orientation within the maze. This includes identifying walls and
potential obstacles and updating its path dynamically based on these inputs.
- Collision avoidance: The robot navigated the maze without colliding with any walls or obstacles.
This showcases the effectiveness of the implemented sensor-based decision-making and path planning.
- Dynamic pathfinding: The robot adapted its route in real-time, recalculating paths when encountering
unforeseen obstacles or dead ends. This ability is crucial in demonstrating the effectiveness of the maze
navigation algorithms.
- Reaching the destination: The ultimate goal is for the robot to find and reach the specified destination
point within the maze which it did. Successfully doing so would indicate that the robot can combine sensor data,
orientation, and pathfinding algorithms to solve complex navigational challenges.
- Visual and auditory feedback: Upon reaching the destination, the robot should provide a clear indication
of its success, such as changing the color of its lights, to signal the completion of its task.
